# An Introduction to JavaScript testing with Jasmine BDD 

This presentation and code is designed to give a high-level overview of some of the basic features of [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), the BDD framework for JavaScript from the folks at Pivotal Labs.

If you're interested in learning about Jasmine, I encourage you to [download the project](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-intro/zipball/master) and play with the sample code while thumbing through the slides. If test-driving is old hat to you, then I'd be enthused to hear your feedback!  

This presentation is also available [for view online at iWork.com](http://public.iwork.com/document/?d=jasmine-intro.key&a=p94397438)
