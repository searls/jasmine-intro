# An Introduction to JavaScript testing with Jasmine BDD 

This presentation and code is designed to give a high-level overview of some of the basic features of [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine), the BDD framework for JavaScript from the folks at Pivotal Labs.

If you're interested in learning about Jasmine, I encourage you to download the project and play with the sample code while thumbing through the slides. If test-driving is old hat to you, then I'd be enthused to hear your feedback!
